# Submission Readme.md

This submission includes several files that include the code for the different objectives. Below is a guide to navigating and utilizing the Python files and the notebooks for review or further development.

## Project Structure

**Objective 1: Data Collection**: The necessary data was collected in an Excel-sheet and can be found in the file 432_finalProject_task1.xlsx

**Objective 2: Orbits**: This objective contains the main file orbits_earth.py, which has all the necessary functions to simulate orbits in our solar system. The same code is used in the corresponding Notebook orbits_earth.ipynb to generate plots and animations. Orbits of Endor are calculated in an analogous manner in the file orbits_endor.py.

**Objective 3: Surface Impacts**: The calculations and plots can all be found in the file surface_impacts.ipynb.

**Objective 4: Disappearance and Crash**: The last objective is analyzed with the code in the file final_project.ipynb.


### Running the Code

**Python files**: They can be executed after opening it and will produce plots and numerical results. 
For objective 2: Different plots are obtained by changing parameters in this code, which is easily understood when looking at the corresponding notebook.

**Jupyter Notebooks**: Begin by running the cell in the Background section (the first cell with code). This cell imports all necessary libraries and defines the constants used throughout the analysis. It's crucial to run this cell first to ensure that subsequent cells execute without errors.

- **Backup file: If you find problem running the `final_project.ipynb`, there is `final_project.pdf` file as a backup of it.
