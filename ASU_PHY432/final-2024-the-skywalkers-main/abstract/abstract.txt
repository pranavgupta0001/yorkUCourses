Gravitational Impacts of the Death Star on Endor and Earth-like planets

Simon Tebeck, Pranav Gupta

This study investigates the gravitational impacts of a hypothetical massive space station, akin to the Death Star from popular media, on celestial bodies such as the fictional planet Endor or Earth and Moon. Fascinated by this iconic science-fiction weapon, the core objective was to determine how such a massive artificial body could influence planetary orbits and surface gravitational forces, as well as the potential effects of its sudden disappearance or crash into a planet. Utilizing Velocity Verlet with Newton's Law of Gravity, simulations were conducted to model the interactions between the Death Star, planets, and moons. Results indicated measurable orbital perturbations for Earth and especially the Moon and a significant distortion of the angular velocity. Furthermore, the proximity of the Death Star would cause enormous tides and dangerous, kilometer-high waves. The study also demonstrated noticeable destabilization in planetary orbits following the hypothetical sudden disappearance of the Death Star and its crash into a planet would lead to global mass extinction. Future work may explore the addition of more bodies and variable orbital elements to enhance simulation realism or a more sophisticated tides calculation.
